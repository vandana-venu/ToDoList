# WeDo-ToDo-List-Application
In this application, first, there is a login session. Users can log in only into the web app using the username “admin” and password “12345”. The JS will check the login validation and if the login true, then using the concept of “Callback Function”, it redirect to the main page.   On the main page, there is a navigation bar with menus (Todo List, LogOut). On the Todo list page, we can retrieve the daily tasks (to-do lists) from the API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) and in that mark the todos that the user already completed. If the user marked 5 todos as completed, then an alert box will pop up and show “ Congrats. 5 Tasks have been Successfully Completed ” (Uses the concept of Promise() for the validation of 5 Completed TodoLists ).   When the user click on the LogOut menu in the navbar, it redirect to the login page. The whole User Interface should is responsive by using Bootstrap.
